/**
 * A courier whose shipments can be tracked on a public page addressed by
 * the tracking number alone.
 *
 * Optional, on purpose. The main contract's trackingLinks() carries the
 * per-shipment URLs a courier hands back through its API, and some hand
 * back none: QuadX answered `links: []` on a live refresh of a booked
 * parcel. A courier that also runs a public tracker implements this; one
 * that does not simply leaves it unimplemented and falls back to whatever
 * its API returned, or to plain text, which is honest.
 *
 * Owner ruling 2026-09-03: where a courier implements this, its public
 * tracker WINS over the API's per-shipment links rather than standing in
 * for them. An API link can point somewhere the shopper does not recognise
 * (QuadX returns fareye.co, its logistics platform, not GoGo Xpress, the
 * brand they bought from), and the queue and the customer must never be
 * shown two different addresses for one parcel.
