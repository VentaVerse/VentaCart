 * What goes in one LBC booking: the packaging code, weight, size, value and
 * the amount to collect. Weights and volumes follow the Pickup Request data
 * dictionary: volumetric weight is L x W x H / 3500 (kg), the chargeable
 * weight is the higher of actual and volumetric, and CBM is for sea freight
 * only, so an air booking sends 0.
 *
 * Dimensions are required for BOX (the store's own packaging), because no
 * standard size stands behind it. For LBC's own packaging they may be left
 * out, all three together, and are then sent as 0: LBC publishes no
 * standard sizes for its packaging, and whether it accepts 0 there is still
 * to be confirmed with LBC. A refusal is a definite rejection, so it costs
 * no tracking number.
