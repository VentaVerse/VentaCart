/**
 * One LBC pickup request, from an order to LBC's answer.
 *
 *   prepare()  reads the account, resolves both addresses through LBC's
 *              address search and serviceability check, and lists anything
 *              that would stop the booking. Read-only calls only.
 *   preview()  the request as it would be sent, with the tracking number it
 *              would use, without taking that number. Sends nothing.
 *   send()     reserves the next tracking number, sends the request once and
 *              settles the number by LBC's answer: spent when LBC saved it
 *              or the outcome is unknown, released when LBC definitely
 *              rejected it. Never retries.
