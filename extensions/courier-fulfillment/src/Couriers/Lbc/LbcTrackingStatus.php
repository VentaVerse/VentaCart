 * LBC's Track and Trace events turned into this module's status words.
 *
 * Track and Trace V2 (Table 6.0) gives every event a StatusId and a text,
 * but many different events share StatusId 0: picked up, received at a
 * branch, forwarded, ready for pickup, and the COD remittance. So an event
 * is read by its id first and by its text whenever the id alone does not
 * say what happened. An id this class does not know is read by its text,
 * and anything still unrecognised counts as in transit, never as delivered.
 *
 * The words are this module's own (stored on orders.courier_status and used
 * as the keys of the status map), so they never change once shipped.
