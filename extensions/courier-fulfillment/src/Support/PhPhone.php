/**
 * The module's single PH mobile-number rule.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim out of SpxFulfillment::normalizePhPhone() (which now
 * delegates here) so the pickup-address form validates a number by exactly
 * the rule the courier payload will later be built with. A second, looser
 * rule in the form would let an operator save a number SPX then refuses at
 * booking time, which is the failure this shares one implementation to avoid.
 *
 * SPX states the format (docs/spx/api.md §1.4, sender_phone/deliver_phone):
 * "11 digits starting with 0, or 12 digits starting with 63". Everything but
 * digits is stripped first, so the shapes actually seen in the dev DB all
 * resolve: "+63 917 123 4567" and "639171234567" pass through as 12 digits
 * starting with 63; "09171234567" passes through as-is; a bare 10-digit
 * mobile gains its leading zero. Anything else (a landline, a truncated
 * number, free text) is not a PH mobile and returns null.
