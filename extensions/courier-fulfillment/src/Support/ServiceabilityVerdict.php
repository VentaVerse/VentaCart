/**
 * One courier's answer to "will you carry this parcel to this address?".
 *
 * THREE answers, never two. The third is the whole point of this object: a
 * courier we could not reach has NOT refused the address, and reporting it as
 * a refusal would make the booking modal lie during an outage. `unknown` is
 * therefore a first-class verdict that the UI renders as a still-clickable
 * card, because the courier itself remains the authority and the operator is
 * allowed to go and ask it.
 *
 * `kind` is WHICH failure this is, once we have recognised it: a destination
 * we do not reach, an origin we will not collect from, COD we will not do
 * there, a postcode we do not accept, a parcel we will not carry. A
 * recognised kind is what lets the modal write ONE sentence of our own that
 * names the destination and reads the same whichever courier said it.
 *
 * `reason` is the courier's OWN words, verbatim, never our paraphrase. It is
 * shown ONLY when `kind` is null, because an unrecognised failure is a
 * failure whose only useful description is theirs (owner ruling, 2026-08-12:
 * printing both our sentence and theirs was redundant). It is deliberately
 * left NULL for a transport failure, where the message would be curl's or
 * ours and never the courier's.
 *
 * `fees` is the price map the same call happened to return (QuadX's
 * /orders/estimates/rates answers with a fee per parcel category), keyed by
 * that courier's own parcel value so the booking form can print an exact fee
 * beside each parcel option. Empty is normal: a courier can serve an address
 * without quoting anything.
