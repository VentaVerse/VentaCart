/**
 * Issues tracking numbers from a block the courier assigned to the store.
 *
 * The courier does not check uniqueness for us, so this is the only thing
 * standing between two parcels and one tracking number. Every number moves
 * through three states (see TrackingNumber):
 *
 *   reserve()  takes the lowest released number, or the next unused one,
 *              and marks it reserved. Done under a row lock on the series,
 *              so two concurrent bookings can never take the same number.
 *   spend()    the courier saved the request, or the outcome is unknown
 *              (timeout, network error, unreadable answer): it may exist on
 *              the courier's side, so it is never issued again.
 *   release()  the courier definitely rejected the request and saved
 *              nothing: the number goes back and is the next one issued.
 *
 * A reservation that is never settled (the process died mid-request) stays
 * reserved and is never issued again, which is the safe reading of "we do
 * not know".
 *
 * Numbers never leave the block: past the last number every claim refuses,
 * and a warning is logged once the remaining count falls to
 * WARN_REMAINING_FRACTION of the block, because a new block is requested
 * from the courier by hand and takes time.
